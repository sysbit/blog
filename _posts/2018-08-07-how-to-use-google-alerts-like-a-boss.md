Google Alerts, One Google Service you probably don’t know about or might have stumbled on and don't know what it is all about?... Have ever wanted to keep track of things you are interested in?<!--more--> You really want to stay to date but don’t want to go through the hassle of surfing the internet for solution. Do you wish there was an application or service for that? Well, look no further, Google Alerts is here for you. 
Google alert is a content change detection and notification service that sends emails to users when it finds new results that matches the user’s search term(s). Simply put, you get notified about new fun stuff that you actually want to see. How cool is that?
One great thing about Google Alerts is that it can also be a valuable tool for your business. How? You can monitor exactly what people are saying about your brand, you can also legitimately “snoop” on you competitors too (you didn’t hear this from me). In essence, Google Alerts can be an essential tool if you are willing to harness its potential. To sign up, all you need is a gmail account then go to [<Google Alerts Page>](https://www.google.com/alerts). That’s all!
